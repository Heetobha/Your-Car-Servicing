                            <b>Jeff Matt</b> founded Victory Auto Service & Glass with a commitment to providing
                            exceptional
                            service to those in need of automotive repair and maintenance. Growing up in Minnesota, Jeff
                            worked as an automotive technician before opening Victory Auto Service & Glass. Jeff had
                            always dreamed of opening a shop where the customer always felt cared for, never felt taken
                            advantage of, and always received the highest quality service at the best price.

                            Victory Auto Service & Glass first opened our doors in 1997 with a small, one-bay shop in
                            Spring Lake Park. We have been growing ever since, thanks to our loyal and supportive
                            customers like you.

                <hr>
                <p>When we open an auto repair shop, we join a community. At all of our locations we believe in
                    participating in actively serving those in community with us. A primary way we serve others in our
                    community is though exceptional auto repair services at straight-forward, competitive prices you
                    deserve. Also serving our community can mean partnering with organizations who are in our community
                    and are doing good every day.</p>
