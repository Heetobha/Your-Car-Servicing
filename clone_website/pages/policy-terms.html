                <h3>Sharing Personal Information</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>In the preceding twelve (12) months, we may sell and/or disclose each of the above-identified
                        categories for our business purposes. This includes but is not limited to, for example:</p>
                    <li>Victory Auto Service & Glass, LLC and its affiliates, and related entities.</li>
                    <li>Any successor to the service center(s) you visited and/or to the nearest Victory Auto location
                        if the shop you visited ceased operating.</li>
                    <li>Third parties to whom you or your agents authorize us to disclose your personal information in
                        connection with products or services we provide to you. For example, if you purchased a road
                        hazard warranty on a tire, your information is sent to the entity that administers that program.
                    </li>
                    <li>Vendors that provide services on our behalf, including hosting and maintaining our website,
                        sending emails and customer communications for us, providing marketing assistance, and sending
                        customer reminders and other advertising.</li>
                    <p>We do not knowingly collect, disclose or sell the information of any minor.</p>
                </ul>
                <h3>Your Rights and Choices</h3>
                <p>The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal
                    information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
                <h3>How to Exercise Your CCPA Rights</h3>
                <p>1. Contact Us <br> <br>

                    To exercise your rights under the CCPA, please submit a verifiable consumer request by calling us at
                    this telephone number 1-866-649-8473, by completing this web form or emailing us at web@tbccorp.com.
                    <br>
                    You may submit a verifiable consumer request on your own behalf or on the behalf of your minor
                    child.
                    <br>
                    In addition, you may designate an agent to submit a verifiable consumer request on your behalf for a
                    request to know information or to delete information. However, you must provide the agent written
                    permission authorizing the agent to submit the request on your behalf. The agent must also verify
                    his/her identity with us directly before we will provide him/her your information. This is not
                    required of the authorized agent if you have provided the agent a power of attorney through Probate
                    Court.
                    <br>
                    An authorized agent must provide the requested proof or we may deny the request. Additionally, the
                    verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us reasonably to verify
                    you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. It
                    must also describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand,
                    evaluate, and respond to it.
                    <br>
                    We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your
                    identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
                    Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
                    <br>
                    Requests are limited. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability
                    twice within a 12-month period.
                    <br>
                    2. Requests
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</li>
                    <p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection
                        and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and verify your
                        request, we will disclose to you:</p>
                    <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
                    <li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
                    <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information (if
                        applicable).</li>
                    <li>The categories of other parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
                    <li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data
                        portability request).</li>
                    <li>If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists
                        disclosing:
                        <ul>
                            <li>sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient
                                purchased; and </li>
                            <li> disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories
                                that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Deletion Request Rights</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we have about
                    you, subject to certain exceptions.
                    <br><br>
                    We may deny your deletion request, or fulfill it only in part, based on our legal rights and
                    obligations. For example, we may keep personal information as permitted by the CCPA, such as for tax
                    purposes or to process transactions and facilitate customer requests.
                    <br> <br>
                    3. Response Timing and Format
                    <br> <br>
                    Upon receiving your request to know or a request to delete, we will confirm receipt of the request
                    and provide information about how we will process the request, including our verification process.
                    We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request to know and/or to delete within 45 days of
                    its receipt, though we may take up to an additional 45 days (for a total of 90-days) if necessary.
                    Any disclosures we provide may only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer
                    request's receipt.
                    <br> <br>
                    We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is
                    excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we
                    will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your
                    request.
                <h3> Non-Discrimination</h3>
                <br> <br>

                We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.

                Surveys, Sweepstakes & Contests
                <br> <br>
                Occasionally Victory Auto may request information from users of our Website via surveys, sweepstakes or
                contests. Participation in these surveys, sweepstakes or contests is completely voluntary, and the users
                of our Websites have a choice regarding participation and the type of information they disclose.
                Information requested may include contact information (such as your name and shipping address) and
                demographic information (such as zip code and age level). We use such information to notify contest
                winners, to award prizes and to analyze the website traffic to improve the user's experience on all of
                our Website. All participation in surveys, sweepstakes and contests is subject to applicable law, the
                applicable rules and terms and conditions that accompany each of these contests or sweepstakes. These
                rules, terms and conditions may be accessed at the time of your participation.

                Data Sharing and Disclosures
                <br> <br>
                Victory Auto will not trade, sell, or share the personal information you have submitted to any third
                party, excluding affiliates companies, without your consent except that the personal information you
                provide may be used by any of Victory Auto’ affiliated companies or franchisee dealers, or third-party
                business partners who may need to use such information to help Victory Auto administer certain
                promotions, provide technical services for the Website, and address a question or concern about our
                products and services. If you do provide us with your consent, we may also share your personal
                information with third parties so that they may send you product offers, personalized offers and tips or
                ask you for feedback on how to make Victory Auto’ products and programs better for yourself and others.
                <br> <br>
                Victory Auto may be required to disclose personal information to law enforcement, governmental
                authorities, or third parties if (i) required to do so by law, search warrant, subpoena, court order or
                other legal process, (ii) requested by law enforcement or other government authorities, or (iii) Victory
                Auto believes such action is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property or personal safety of
                Victory Auto and its Website, visitors to the Website and customers of our products and services.
                <br>
                <br>
                Please note that because a customer information database is considered a business asset, Victory Auto
                reserves the right to transfer the database in a merger or sale of some or all of its company or in an
                action for bankruptcy. Your information will continue to be treated in accordance with this Privacy
                Policy by the acquiring or merged company unless you are notified and provided an opportunity to change
                your preferences.

                Data Sharing and Disclosures
                <br> <br>

                submit personally identifiable information, Victory Auto takes commercially accepted and recommended
                steps to protect that information both on- and off-line. Nevertheless, currently no data transmission
                over the Internet or method of storage - electronic or otherwise - can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

                which contain important information about our Website and our product and service offerings, including
                those from its affiliated companies, which we believe to be of value to our customers and users. To
                facilitate this, we may enhance or merge the information we collect on our Website with data lawfully

                <br> <br>
                We may communicate with the users of our Website via e-mail, telephone, mail or fax to provide services,

                receive such marketing communications.

                <br> <br>

                Our e-mail messages have an "unsubscribe" feature for prior users of our Websites who have become our
                customers, but do not want to be notified about special offers in the future. At any time, users can
                "reply" back to the e-mail message and type "unsubscribe" in the subject field. We will remove that
                e-mail address from our e-mail lists. To ensure proper updating of account information, users with more
                than one e-mail address are asked to include those in any "unsubscribe" request. Users who do not wish
                to have postal mail information, phone number or ordering information shared with third party
                organizations, can opt out by: (i) mail us at Victory Auto Auto Service & Glass, LLC, Attn: Consumer
